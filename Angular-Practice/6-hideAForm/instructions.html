		<h1>Objective</h1>
		<p>You are responsible for building a profile page for users on a social network. This profile page should give the user the ability to edit their information directly on the page, but we don't want to always show the form. Write an HTML page with a form which will edit the user's profile, but make the form initially hidden and add a 'Show Form' button which will toggle the visibility of the form.</p>
		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		
		<ol>
		<li>Create all the HTML for your form and profile page. The form should appear on top and the user's profile should appear below. Include separate fields for the following: name, bio, favorite books, favorite Javascript libraries</li>
		<li>Add a submit handler to the form element. On submit, update the text of user's profile below.</li>
		<li>Change the CSS so that the form is hidden when the page loads.</li>
		<li>Add a 'Show Form' button which, when clicked, makes the form visible for the user to edit. (Try some directives like ng-show or ng-class. Which method is easier?)</li>
		<li>When the form is hidden, the button should say 'Show Form'. When the form is shown, the button should say 'Hide Form' and perform the appropriate action.</li>
		</ol>
